# demo_application-
This is a demo application to showcase my skills in: animation, api control as well as formatting and UI Design

This is nothing more than to preview some skills I demonstrate in iOS development in Objective-C. Improvements to make to future releases of this demo include:

- UIButton in animation to contain only one function not several for animation, where the animations get seperated into classes and then just called on command when the button is pressed.
- Reorganizing some of the code to work better with iOS8 and iPhone 4s

After about an hour of just learning about the whole code set and how it functions, 
I set off programming and here are the break downs:

1. UI Design: Took about 2 hours of work to put everything together in the right place. 

2. Animating: 
- Was not difficult used a Quartz Library to perform the animation. 
Initially was going to use a rotation, however the instructions 
did specify animate.
- Designed a three layer animation system, depending on how many times
you press spin, something different will happen in that screen.
This also includes some sounds with the animations and designing my own
animation of the logo
- Total hours 2-3 

3. API Connection:
- Having previously designed a copy of Instagram, I had very solid
knowledge of how an API through a JSON file functions so was easily able 
to parse it out and extract neccessary information.
- Need to look some references and examples for connections, however
everything after that went smooth.
- Total hours: 2

4. Chat
- Easiest part of the whole build, just referenced once again my 
Instagram copy for how JSON files are parsed for images
- Looking up how to make a circular image was an easily 1-2 line code
- Had to reformat the cell a bit too however, was not a struggle, 
and was able to fit all text featured in the preloaded file. 
- Total Hours: 1-2

Total Time Spent: 8-9 hours
